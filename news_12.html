            <p>As the Parisians travel to Toulouse for Matchday 2 of Ligue 1 on Saturday 19 August at 21:00, we take a closer 
                look at the forthcoming encounter at the Stadium. We take a look at what's in store for the Rouge et Bleu when 
                they take on TFC, including memories, standings, dynamics and players to watch.</p>

            <h3>
                A LOOK AT THE STANDINGS
            </h3>
            <p>Paris Saint-Germain picked up their first point of the season with a 0-0 draw against FC Lorient on Saturday. 
                The club from the capital are now two points behind Stade Rennais FC, AS Monaco, Stade Brestois 29, Olympi
                que de Marseille and RC Strasbourg, who all won their opening games, and Toulouse FC, the Parisians' future 
                opponents.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, Toulouse made a perfect start to their campaign with their first win coming in injury time at 
                FC Nantes. Having finished 13th in the league last term, Les Violets will once again be aiming to stay up as 
                quickly as possible before setting their sights on bigger things.</p>
            <p>Carles Martinez Novell's side, who won the last Coupe de France, are gearing up for an exceptional season that
                will culminate in a European Cup campaign, fourteen years after their last appearance on the continental stage.
                Buoyed by their recent victories over Osasuna (Spain) and AS Roma (Italy), Toulouse confirmed their good form 
                on Matchday 1 of Ligue 1. On Saturday evening, the Rouge et Bleu will be up against a team full of confidence.</p>

            <h3>A LOOK BACK AT THE LAST GAME BETWEEN THE TWO TEAMS</h3>
            <p>The two sides last met on Matchday 22 of the 2022-2023 season on 4 February. The visitors made life difficult 
                for the Parisians at the Parc des Princes, but they still managed to win. However, it was Toulouse who struck 
                first, Branco Van den Boomen opening the scoring with a free-kick that left Gianluigi Donnarumma helpless 
                (0-1, 20'). Paris responded just after the half-hour mark when Marquinhos headed against the post from a cor
                ner.</p>
            <p>But five minutes later, Paris's perseverance was rewarded when Achraf Hakimi cut inside from the right and curl
                ed a superb left-footed shot to level the scores (1-1, 38'). In the second half, it was Léo Messi who gave Paris 
                Saint-Germain the lead just before the hour mark. Following another fine piece of work from Hakimi, the Argen
                tinian international collected the ball on the edge of the area and crucified Maxime Dupé with a left-footed 
                shot (2-1, 58'). Thanks to an imperious Gigio Donnarumma, Toulouse were unable to get back into the game and
                saw Paris win after a lively battle.</p>
            <img src="image/news_12_03.png" alt="12_3">
            <h3> THE OPPONENTS' STRENGTHS </h3>
            <p>Carles Martinez Novell and his team are mainly playing a 4-2-3-1 system. In goal, the very young Guillaume 
                Restes (18) seems to be taking over from Maxime Dupé, now a former Toulouse goalkeeper. Despite his obvious
                lack of experience, this pure product of Toulouse's youth system proved decisive against Nantes in his very first 
                official match for the first team. In central defence, the Rasmus Nicolaisen/Logan Costa pairing looks set to 
                hold its own. Nicolaisen was already a key figure for TFC last season, having made the most clearances (152) 
                and blocked the most balls (58). As for Logan Costa, the Cape Verde international seems to have got the better 
                of Frenchman Anthony Rouault, who was a regular starter last season.</p>
            <p>On the right flank, Denmark's Mikkel Desler, the Toulouse defender who made the most tackles last season (38),
                has established himself as the starter ahead of his Norwegian counterpart Warren Kamanzi. On the left, Chilean 
                international Gabriel Suazo has a clear path, as his understudy Oliver Zandén is still unavailable through injury. 
                The Chilean full-back is capable of accompanying his team-mates' attacks, and was the Toulouse defender 
                with the highest percentage of successful dribbles last season (64.7%).</p>
            <img src="image/news_12_04.png" alt="12_4">
            <p>In midfield, it is the Vincent Sierro/Cristian Cásseres pairing that seems to be making a name for itself. The for
                mer arrived in January from Young Boys Berne in Switzerland and has been given the captain's armband by 
                TFC's Spanish coach for the coming season. Comfortable in a deep-lying playmaker's role, he is joined by Vene
                zuelan international Cristian Cásseres, freshly arrived from New York Red Bulls (USA). A technically gifted and 
                rugged player, he has already found his place in Toulouse's starting eleven. As for Denis Genreau, the Australian
                 international is a little higher up in the No.10 position. After a successful end to last season, he has a head start 
                over new signings Niklas Schmidt and César Galabert.</p>
            <p>On the left flank, Moussa Diarra and Franck Magri are vying for a starting place. The former usually plays in a mo
                re defensive role, while the latter is discovering Ligue 1 after a promising season with SC Bastia (Ligue 2) last 
                year, and can also play on the right. The two Toulouse players have been brought in to compensate for the inju
                ry to Algerian international Farès Chaïbi (8 goals, 7 assists last season), who returned to the squad against Nante
                s and could potentially start the game against the Parisians.</p>
            <p>On the right wing, Zakaria Aboukhlal (15 goals, 5 assists last season) is one of Les Violets' main weapons. As 
                hard-hitting as ever, the Moroccan international was Toulouse's most successful dribbler last season (42). Last 
                but not least, Thijs Dallinga is the undisputed starter in the Toulouse attack. There is no doubt that the man who 
                was TFC's top scorer last season in all competitions (18 goals, 3 assists) will once again want to put his finishing 
                skills to good use and cause problems for the Parisian defence.</p>
            <img src="image/news_12_05.png" alt="12_5">
            <p>Despite their different skill sets, Manuel Ugarte and Vincent Sierro are set to do battle in midfield this Saturday. 
                Last season, the former Sporting CP (Portugal) midfielder completed far more progressive passes than his Toul
                ouse counterpart (120 compared to 49). Generally speaking, the Uruguayan international is more successful 
                with his passes than the Swiss midfielder (91.6% versus 78.7%). He also made more key passes, with 15 last sea
                son compared to Vincent Sierro's 11.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Toulouse's new captain was more accurate in his attempts on goal, with 33.3% of shots on tar
                get compared to 15.8% for the young Uruguayan. A technically gifted player, Vincent Sierro had a particularly hig
                h percentage of successful dribbles (75% compared to 54.8% for Manuel Ugarte). Lastly, the Swiss midfielder 
                committed fewer fouls than his future opponent, with only 37 fouls called against him last season compared to 
                64 against the new Parisian midfielder.</p>
