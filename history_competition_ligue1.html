                <h2>LIGUE 1 UBER EATS</h2>
                <p>Ligue 1 Uber Eats is played every season in the form of a two-legged league 
                    with 20 professional clubs. Historically, the competition starts in the summer 
                    and ends in the spring, with periods of international matches and two merca
                    to. Named National Division until 1972, the competition then took the name 
                    of Division 1 until it was renamed Ligue 1 in 2002, and finally Ligue 1 Uber Eats 
                    in 2020 following a naming contract between the league and the delivery 
                    company.</p>
                <p>The history of the competition is closely linked to emblematic clubs such as 
                    AS Saint-Étienne,Stade de Reims, FC Nantes, Olympique de Marseille or more
                    recently Paris Saint-Germain, giving place to many derbies and other classics

                <h2>THE STAKES OF THE LIGUE 1</h2>
                <p>The current UEFA index allows Uber Eats League 1 to directly qualify the 1st 
                    and 2nd of its championship for the Champions League group stage. The 3rd 
                    will have to compete in a play-off to hope playing in the C1 while the 4th will 
                    get a qualifying place for the Europa League.</p>
                <p>The other qualifying place for the C3 is now awarded to the winner of the pre
                    vious edition of the French Cup. It is therefore the 5th of the French champion
                    ship that will validate generally its ticket to play the Europa League Conferenc
                    e. In the case where the winner of the French Cup has already obtained a ticke
                    t for the C1 or C3, the 5th place would then directly qualify for the group stage 
                    of the Europa League and the 6th would allow a club to have the opportunity 
                    to play the C4 play-offs.</p>
                <p>With the new reform of the Champions League coming into effect in 2024, if 
                    France maintains its 5th place in the UEFA index, the top three Ligue 1 teams 
                    will automatically qualify for the Champions League while the 4th place will 
                    be synonymous with a play-off for the C1.</p>
                <p>Concerning the principle of up and down between Ligue 1 Uber Eats and Ligu
                    e 2 BKT, only the two clubs finishing in 17th and 18th place are automatically 
                    relegated to the second division. On the other hand, the 1st and 2nd in Ligue 2 
                    integrate the elite of French soccer.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Founded on August 12, 1970, as a result of a merger between Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germanois, Paris Saint-Germain had its first experience 
                    in the elite of French soccer in the 1971-1972 season, only one year after the creation of the club. The following year, the two entities were split: 
                    Paris FC was maintained in the 1st division while Paris Saint-Germain continued under the same name in the 3rd division.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1974, Paris Saint-Germain was back in the elite of French soccer while Paris FC was relegated to the second division: the club of Saint-Germ
                    ain-en-Laye left the Georges-Lefèvre stadium and will now play in the historic Parc des Princes. PSG became the number 1 club in the capital. 
                    In 1986, Paris Saint-Germain won its first ever French championship title, led at the time by its captain Luis Fernandez and its top scorer Domi
                    nique Rocheteau.

                        European great. The project took shape quickly with the arrival of internation
