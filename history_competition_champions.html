                    trip matches in the form of a mini championship. The first two teams in the 
                    group qualify for the round of 16 of the competition, while the third team is 
                    sent to the Europa League. This is followed by a knockout phase in which the 
                    clubs play each other in 1/8, 1/4 and ½ finals in home and away matches. As 
                    for the final, it is played in a single match.</p>
                <p>The history of the competition is closely linked to emblematic clubs such as 
                    AS Saint-Étienne,Stade de Reims, FC Nantes, Olympique de Marseille or more
                    recently Paris Saint-Germain, giving place to many derbies and other classics

                    <p>Broadcast in almost every country in the world, the Champions League is eve
                        ry year one of the most watched sports events on the planet. Its final has alre
                        ady gathered nearly 340 million European, American, African and Asian view
                        ers, all sharing the same fervor for this unique competition. This competition, 
                        founded in 1955, represents a lot for the participating clubs, beyond the simp
                        le sporting and prestigious aspect that it arouses.</p>
                    <p>A participation in the Champions League represents a major financial stake 
                        for the qualified clubs. From TV rights, ticketing, participation and performan
                        ce bonuses to matchday revenues, a Champions League campaign brings in 
                        millions for the participating clubs. These revenues can be a great asset in 
                        the construction of a mercato budget during the transfer period, especially 
                        for clubs in full development.</p>
                    <p>Beyond the financial power that a participation in the Champions League brin
                        gs, the competition offers a strong attractiveness to the clubs that are enga
                        ged in it. Visibility, prestige and top matches, all the elements that a football 
                        player would like to experience in his career are combined in this same com
                        petition. The clubs that qualify for the Champions League have a decisive 
                        advantage in attracting the world's biggest stars, international players or futu

                    <p>Participation in the Champions League also means exposure to the 5 contin
                        ents. It is when the UEFA anthem resounds, which has become mythical over
                         the years, that clubs can give themselves the opportunity to showcase them
                        selves and shine on the European stage... watched by fans from all over the w
                        orld. When a club performs well in the Champions League, its whole instituti
                        on is impacted. Its brand image is enhanced, its notoriety improved, and this 
                        is how clubs build powerful sporting identities becoming brands remaining 
                        over time.</p>
                    <p>This is the case of Real Madrid, FC Barcelona or Manchester United, whose C1
                        victories have been echoed throughout the world and have resulted in the co
                       nstruction of communities that go far beyond the borders of their countries. 
                       These fans are at the origin of the numerous sales of shirts, merchandising 
                       and television rights and constitute the very value of these sports entities. 
                       Today, the biggest European clubs playing in C1 compete with the great Ame
                       rican sports franchises such as the New Yorks Yankees (MLB), the Dallas Cob

                <h2>
                    80'S: THE BEGINNING OF AN ADVENTURE
                </h2>
                <p>In the post-war years, professional soccer in Europe was reduced to the existence of national championships and prestigious midweek 
                    friendlies. Some competitions between Western European clubs (Latin Cup) and Central European clubs (Mitropa Cup) were played at that 
                    time but no competition between the best clubs of the continent existed yet.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1954, when the English club Wolverhampton was crowned champion of England, it met Racing of Avellaneda, Spartak Moscow and Bud
                    apest Honvéd in friendly matches between world clubs. Wolves were far from the favorites, but they managed to beat all three teams and the 
                    Daily Mail declared Wolverhampton "World Club Champions".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gabriel Hanot, editor-in-chief of the newspaper L'Equipe at the time, responded by pointing out to the English press and to the whole of 
                    Europe the presence of many prestigious clubs such as Real Madrid or AC Milan capable of competing with Wolves. Under the impulse
                    of the French daily newspaper, a project of European Interclub Cup was launched, which met with positive reactions throughout Europe. 
                    On February 3, 1955, the newspaper L'Equipe unveiled the list of 16 clubs invited to compete in the first edition of this competition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the organization of this European interclub competition was intended for the newspaper l'Equipe, FIFA finally pushed the Union
                     of European Football Associations (UEFA), founded only one year earlier, to take over the organization of this competition. On September 4, 
                    1955, Sporting Portugal hosted the Yugoslavian team Patizan Belgrade in Lisbon in front of 30,000 spectators curious to discover 
                    this new competition and their European neighbors. This was the birth of the European Champion Clubs' Cup. A few months later, the 
                    final of the first edition was held between Di Stefano's Real Madrid and Raymond Kopa's Stade de Reims. That evening in June 1956, 
                    the Madrid club became the first club in history to win the C1 with a 4-3 victory at the Parc des Princes.
                </p>
                <strong>Real Madrid are the most successful club in the history 
                    of the competition with 14 trophies won</strong>
            </div>
            <div class="adap1230">
                <div>
                    <p>The first edition of the competition was a real success and UEFA imposed tha
                        t only the winners of European championships should be allowed to take part 
                        in the next edition. English clubs did not take part in the first edition, but the 
                        following year the Red Devils of Manchester United joined the competition. 
                        In the following years, more and more teams were invited to take part in the 
                        European Champion Clubs' Cup. French clubs such as OGC Nice and then 
                        ASSE, AS Monaco and FC Nantes took their turn in the competition. It was 
                        only a few years after its creation that clubs such as Barcelona, Juventus and 
                        Inter Milan made their appearance in the competition, which had only one re
                        presentative per country.</p>
                    <p>More than 35 years after its creation in 1955, the 38th edition of the UEFA 
                        Champions League, in 1992/93, marked a real turning point in the history of 
                        this prestigious competition. The historic European Champion Clubs' Cup 
                        would henceforth be known as the Champions League and the UEFA anthem
                         composed by Tony Britten would be played for the first time in a European 
                        stadium. The group stages were introduced in the previous edition, replacing
                         the lifelong quarter- and semi-finals. In that first UEFA Champions League, 
                        Olympique de Marseille beat AC Milan 1-0 at the Stadion Olimpico in Munich
                        to become the first French club to win the most prestigious competition.
                    </p>
                    <strong>The lyrics of the C1 anthem mix English, 
                        French and German, the three official 
                        languages of UEFA</strong>

            <p>The 2019/20 edition was and will remain a unique edition in the history of the Champions League. Despite the particular health context, 
                a Final 8 is organised in Lisbon to determine a winner among the 8 teams that will face each other in a knockout match. After an epic 
                quarter-final where PSG overturned Atalanta Bergamo in the last minutes of the game, Neymar and Mbappé's teammates faced Leipzig 
                to try to offer the club from the capital, a first final in its history in the most prestigious of competitions.</p>
