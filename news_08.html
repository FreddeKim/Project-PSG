            <p>The Brazilian No.10 officially leaves Paris Saint-Germain. A look back at six crazy years of success, passion and 
                emotion.</p>
            <img src="image/news_08_01.png" alt="08_1">
            <h3>AN ARRIVAL WITH GLOBAL INTEREST</h3>
            <p>In 2017, after a summer tour in Miami, Paris Saint-Germain pulled off a transfer that got the whole planet talking:
                Neymar Jr signed for the club from the capital for a record figure. An arrival that drew attention from across the 
               world, with global TV crews focusing their reporting on Paris and the Club’s new recruit. The Brazilian received 
               an exceptional welcome from the Paris Saint-Germain fans, who travelled en masse to the Parc des Princes, for
                what has become a historic day.</p>
            <p>His press conference at the Parc des Princes, alongside Paris Saint-Germain President, Nasser Al-Khelaïfi, on 
                Friday 4 August 2017 was an event that was broadcast across the four corners of the globe. His first steps in 
                Rouge et Bleu, closely followed by the PSG TV cameras, remain one of the most viewed features in the history 
                of the club.</p>
            <p>Officially presented at the Parc the next day (5 August, during the visit of Amiens on Matchday 1) will remain an 
                indelible moment in the memories of all football fans.</p>
            <h3>IMMEDIATE IMPACT </h3>
            <p>Neymar Jr made his debut in his new colours one week later at Guingamp. He quickly settled into the team, 
                picking up an assist and a goal in his first match for the club, before he went to town on Matchday 3 against 
                Toulouse at the Parc des Princes. Skills, goals, assists... Neymar Jr demonstrated his full repertoire and got the 
                crowd to their feet, both in Paris and beyond. Just a few weeks later, he was joined by Kylian Mbappé, to create 
                an attacking line-up that caught the attention of the whole of Europe.</p>
            <p>Ney shone on both the domestic and continental scene, with notably impressive performances against Bayern 
                and Celtic. Unfortunately, his season ended prematurely, but he still took home a Ligue 1 winners medal, on top
                 of the Coupe de la Ligue and Coupe de France titles.</p>
            <h3>SO MANY MEMORABLE IMAGES</h3>
            <p>The Brazilian prodigy left his mark on everyone he came across as the matches went by. Despite struggling wit
                h injuries, he managed to pull off certain feats that will never be forgotten. Like the goal he scored against 
                Strasbourg on 14 September 2019, with a magical acrobatic effort at the end of the match. Or the hat-trick he 
                scored against Red Star Belgrade at the Parc des Princes in the UEFA Champions League Group Stage on 3 
                October 2018, making him the top Brazilian scorer in the history of the competition.</p>  
            <img src="image/news_08_02.png" alt="08_2">
            <p>How could we forget his winning header against Borussia Dortmund on 11 March 2020, in an empty Parc due to 
                the global pandemic? A header that allowed Les  to defeat the German side and head into the Final 8 in Lisbon 
                where they shone.</p>
            <h3>NJR10'S STATS</h3>
            <p>In total, he played 173 matches for Paris Saint-Germain. A number which could have been a lot higher, but his 
                stats are still hugely impressive. The Brazilian scored 118 goals (almost 0.7 goals per match!), and picked up 70 
                assists. The figures are mind blowing, Neymar Jr was directly involved in a goal on 188 occasions in 173 matches
                 in Rouge et Bleu.  </p>
            <img src="image/news_08_03.png" alt="08_3">
            <p>The honours taken home are equally incredible: 5 Ligue 1 titles, 3 Coupe de France, 2 Coupe de la Ligue and 3 
                Trophées des Champions. 13 trophies in total in the Paris shirt. You can add to that the individual awards he rec
                eived during his time in the Capital. Most Assists (8) in the UEFA Champions League in 2017, member of the FIFA
                 Team of the Year, Player of the Year and Most Assists (13) in Ligue 1 in  2018, and three times Samba d'Or (best 
                Brazilian player in Europe) in 2017, 2020 and 2021.</p>
            <p>Neymar Jr has marked the history of the club on several levels, notably catapulting his side into another dimens
                ion. He left nobody indifferent, causing fans to sing, cry, shout or dance. The adventure was full of events. A jour
                ney that created eternal memories.  </p>
