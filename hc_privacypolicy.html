                <p>As set out above, we share your personal data with PSG, whose brand we are licensed to use in the provision of this website and the products sold on it and who are joint controller thereof.</p>
                <p>We will share your personal data with our service providers, our parent company and affiliated entities. We will have in place an agreement with our service providers (including our parent com
                    pany Fanatics Inc, and other affiliated entities who provide some services for us) which will restrict how they are able to process your personal information and require them to keep it secure. 
                    We use some service providers directly in the fulfilment of your orders, for example for personalisation services, or where products are shipped directly by the manufacturer from their wareho
                    use. Other service provider examples include IT providers, internet service providers, and data analytics providers. We may also use service providers in less direct ways, such as in the provisio
                    n of our payment and finance systems, and to anticipate, prevent, and detect fraud. If any service provider or affiliated entity is based outside of the United Kingdom or the European Economic 
                    Area, we will ensure that the provider is either a current subscriber to the EU/US Privacy Shield, or we have an appropriate contract for the international transfer of personal information with th
                    em. In respect of Fanatics Inc, and our affiliates entities we have a contract in place in the form authorised by the European Commission and the United Kingdom Information Commissioners O
                    ffice for the international transfer of personal data.</p>
                <p>We share some of your data with Rokt Pte Ltd (“Rokt”), who use that information to target their direct marketing to you (where you have consented to receive it). This means that Rokt use the in
                    formation you provide us with, so that they can serve on-site advertisements to you.  We believe this is justified as you are in control over whether you receive our direct marketing, each time w
                    e contact you. More information about how Rokt process your personal data and how you may exercise your rights in relation to that data can be found in their <a href="privacypolicy.html">privacy policy.</a></p>
                <p>Our website also contains scripts from third party affiliates who will gather Observed information about you in order to verify referrals from third party advertising. We do not process this inform
                    ation, but it is collected directly by them and processed in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>
                <p>We may disclose your information to third parties to provide you with services or benefits. For example, if you participate in our Fan Cash program, we may share your personal information with 
                    Business Partners and other third parties to operate the program and allow you to acquire and redeem points.</p>
                <p>We may share any of your personal data with a prospective purchaser or purchaser of any part of our business, or otherwise in connection with a sale, merger, change of control, bankruptcy, or 
                    similar transaction on the basis of our legitimate interests and the interests of our purchaser, so that they can appropriately value the business and assess any risks and continue doing business
                    with you after the acquisition.</p>
                <p>We may share your personal information: (a) as required by law or legal process; (b) to investigate suspected fraud, harassment, or other violations of any law, rule, or regulation; (c) to investigat
                    e suspected violations of any terms or policies applicable to the Properties or the services provided by us or our third party providers or affiliates; or (d) where we reasonably conclude that it is 
                    necessary for defending, exercising or establishing our legal rights.</p>
                <p>Business Partners.  If you have consented, we may share your personal information with third parties for their own purposes (“Business Partners”) (or their service providers), such as for marketi
                    ng purposes. In many cases, such sharing is related to our operation of the website, such as sharing your personal information with a Business Partner when you purchase that Business Partne
                    r's merchandise from us. You may contact us to opt out of such sharing in some cases. However, we do not control how Business Partners use and share your information once they receive it. Y
                    ou will need to contact such Business Partners directly for information about their privacy practices or to exercise rights you may have (including if you would like to opt-out of receiving future 
                    emails from a Business Partner).</p>
                <p>With other third parties with your consent.</p>

                <h3>Exercising your rights</h3>
                <p>We will only retain your personal information for the purposes set out in the policy and for as long as we have a legal or business requirement to do so.  By law, different retention periods apply 
                    for to different types of records and data, however the longest we will normally hold any personal data is 7 years from the date of your last transaction, for taxation, accounting and risk manage
                    ment purposes. This may be extended in the event of a query, investigation or dispute until fully resolved.</p>
